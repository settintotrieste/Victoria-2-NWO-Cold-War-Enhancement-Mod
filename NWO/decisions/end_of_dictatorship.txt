		# presidential_plebiscite_desc;According to the transitional provisions of the New Constitution, a plebiscite was scheduled to vote on a new eight-year presidential term. During the last years of dictatorship the commander in chiefs of the navy, air force and police disassociated themselves from the president expressing their wishes that a civilian should represent the regime in the upcomming elections. The fact the dictatorship respected the results is attributed to pressure from the big business, the international community and unease with extended junta-rule.
